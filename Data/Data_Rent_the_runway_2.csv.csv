Cons: the dress has no lining and is slightly see-through as a result - so I had to be careful picking underwear.

Good thing gingham is in again! The dress was easy to wear, straps adjusted nicely, zipped easy, and was breezy and flowy. Definitely felt it needed a belt but the waist was so high that you had to put the belt high, or you'd see the seam. I originally thought I'd wear the 14 and had tried it on, but accidentally packed the 16 and it worked well. The dress was fabulous for the play, but it's not really my style.

I think it definitely needs a belt, and I loved the way my western belt went with my  Frye boots, but I wish someone told me that it was hanging so low, I would have brought it in a notch or two because this dress really can do great things for your waist if you have one.  If there was one tiny thing I was a little self- conscious about it was the high neck.

I usually wear between a 2 and a 4 and the 2 fit great so if you are in between sizes you can size down 

I have a bigger bust and I was worried about the open back and if the arm hole would be too cut away but it gave decent coverage. I still wore sticky boobs/tape for a little bit of lift and coverage but happily surprised how much I loved this.  On complaint is that I wish it was a little longer, when the hem band hits might look a little funny on taller people.

It was casual enough to not feel over-the top, given the fabric, but it was still dressy too. It is comfortable. I would say it runs large not because it's actually large, but because it's forgiving. It could have fit someone heavier and bigger than me because the waist and shoulder areas are stretchy, and the skit is extremely full through the hips and below. You're not going to run the risk of it being tight, so I would size down. I wore it with the highest heeled shoes I could find. If you're shorter than me- 5'6""- you should probably stay away. It is very long!  I had to be careful not to step on the skirt- even with heels it is FLOOR length!

It's a high quality, lightweight cotton fabric which somehow arrived looking perfect and ready to wear (it was NWT). I tend to wrinkle/crease cotton the moment I put it on, but that never happened with this dress, it stayed looking pristine through 2 wearings. 

It does run large, though you cash easily cinch in the waist.  Would be good if you are buxom.  I wear sizes 6 (mostly) and 4 as a point of reference.  Next time I'll get the XS for sure!

Got it in my usual size 2 and it is works with a strapless bra but barely. I'm small chested (32B), small rib cage, straps aren't adjustable and the front is low cut. Those things combined make the top a little big. This could be fixed by wearing a plunge bra or bralette. If you're larger up top then you're fine. Since the bottom is so flowy a size 0 would have worked for me as well, probably better. At 5'3"" it hits a little above the ankle. The only other cons are that it hurts to lean against the top of the back zipper/clasp and I needed help clasping the top piece. I do like how the skirt is lined.

It has nice movement and I like the design details.  Since I am more petite, I found this dress to be a little long without heels on, the asymmetrical hem is longer on the sides and grazes the ground if I am in flat shoes.  Also, a helpful tip for ladies with a shorter torso, like me, the waist line falls below the belly button and creates this feeling of being too big and saggy up top.  I pulled the waist up to my natural waist and put a tight and thick belt on, so my waist looked more defined and the dress was more flattering.  I had issues with one of the tiny side snap closures, it wouldn't snap in place, so, I left it open, but, wasn't too noticeable, especially, since I had a belt on.  Overall, I like the look of this dress, but it was ill fitting for my frame.  ",Jason Wu,Confetti Floral Dress,$650 original retail,$100,"Multi print silk (100% Silk). Hourglass. Sleeveless.

Fabric is 100% cotton -- light & breathable.  Pockets!  I'm 5'2"" and wore this dress with white Adidas sneakers to dress it down, and the length was just barely* above the floor.  Dress also looks super cute with strappy summer heels.  I experimented by adding a belt at the waist and it works, though I didn't end up wearing it that way.  I really love the ruffled collar -- only thing is that even after ironing it and the ties pretty meticulously, it still bunched up and looked a little wonky.  (Maybe if I turned the iron to a hotter temp that would've fixed the issue; I was just nervous to do so with a RTR garment).  The slight bunchy-ness of the collar + the way the ties curled over once tied in a bow did irk me a bit.  Cotton is not the best fabric to tie a big bow with; once tied, it kinda sticks out, rather than draping down your back elegantly.  Overall: fun, colourful warm-weather dress.
